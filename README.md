# JavaBreakOut
This repo contains my final which I had about 36 hours to spend on. (4 hours a week)<br>
Over the course of creating this project the main thing I struggled with, and am not proud of;
Is <strong>collisions</strong>. Collisions are just such a nightmare, and if you look at the code...
I doubt it makes sense to <strong>ANYONE</strong>.  

Feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/linktlh/JavaBreakOut/issues/new) if you want to provide constructive critizism.
I'm always open to learning new things. such as breaking some sort of java standard etc.
I am aware java swing is a poor choice for graphics, however, I had little time to go and learn javafx or the like.

Over all, it was more of a project for fun and to try to follow some standards!
# Just Exploring my Repos?

If you're just exploring my repos, this is not something I'm very proud of.
However, I do have a compiled jar in releases if you want to see how it works.
